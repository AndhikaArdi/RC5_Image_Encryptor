Problems : this app have big problem in RUNNING TIME especially when you try to proccess a large image or incresing the round number
           (its SUPER SLOW with large image)

Encryptor : key = 'String' , rounds = 'integer' , image = 'image path (use file chooser)' , filename = 'string (with out extension)'

Decryptor : decrypted file = 'file path (use file chooser, with 'txt' extension)'
